# Portfolio Bianca La Manna
Hi! I'm a Digital Humanist recently graduated at the University of Bologna.

This is the [website](https://bianca-lm.github.io/) of my personal portfolio, where you can take a look at my projects and activities, or find the contacts to stay in touch for work and collaborations.
